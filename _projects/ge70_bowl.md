The GE07GE bowl was a gift for a good friend, George, for his 70th birthday.  The blank was fashioned from a repeating “GE” block surrounding a central “70”.  Visually, the 70 registers also as the letters “or”, especially when viewed in reverse.  With a bit of suspended disbelief, the word “GE07GE” appears in multiple directions surrounding the number 70.
 
The bowl is an example of some of Abba’s early work in shallow bowls with a prominent scalloped edge.
