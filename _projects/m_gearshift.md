This project was a surprise gift for Abba’s son Mattan, made stealthily and swiftly over a two-week period when he was away travelling.  It was made to replace the 17-year-old gearshift knob on a 2002 BMW 530i.  A cheap replacement knob was purchased online and disassembled to harvest the inner plastic hub that connects to the transmission.  A custom “M” emblazoned blank was created and then coopered to the classic shape.
 
The “M” is particularly fitting as the first letter in Mattan’s name and also as homage to the classic BMW M series decal.
