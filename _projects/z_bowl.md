The ZGP bowl was a project that Abba’s son envisioned as a Secret Santa gift for a close friend Zack (an accomplished designer and woodworker himself).
 
The design is inspired by the letter “Z” which which zips in and out of a maple background as a streak of walnut punctuated by two abrupt corners.  The corners curl subtly up the side of the bowl. After much pondering and back-and-forth, Abba and Mattan decided to make the edges of bowl scalloped to preserve the size and heftiness of the bowl.

As shown here, an efficient design was planned to limit the number of cuts and maximize the size of the blank with a limited piece of maple.
