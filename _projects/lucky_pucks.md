title: 500th Game Commemorative Pucks

Hi Porcheroo
I am trying to figure out a schedule to get my pucks done. I have the picture glued up. And it just barely makes it. I have a feeling that when all is said and done , it may have to be a tiny bit smaller. It will be close, so getting it just right will make a difference. I am hopin that you could do a couple of things that could save a few hours. (Call me since I can probably answer the phone most of the time.

I would like you to slice off the ends so we have clear surface for waste blocks on both ends. Using slices from the logs make waste pucks (I think you could actually use the ends that already have the centre holes). Lining up the waste pucks on the picture block should let us see if we need to reduce size. If so, do you think we should turn the logs down to a smaller size?  If the solid puck is bigger than the picture disk, do you think our roller jig would work upside down, with the wheels rolling on the picture part?  Anyway call me. Maybe I will be home by the time you get this.
