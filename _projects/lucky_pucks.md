The Lucky Pucks @500 custom wooden puck replicas were a gift to Abbaâ€™s teammates to commemorate 500 games over more than 10 years.  The Lucky Pucks are a special group of dedicated hockey bums that play a weekly hockey game.  The group could be called a beer league, but that would not do justice to the level of organization and commitment that the group shows week after week.  

Each player received a custom, (almost) identical puck, cut from a long blank first turned on the lath and then backed on a piece of solid maple.  The size and tapered edges are just like a real hockey puck.  The dotted line is reminiscent of the centre line on a standard ice hockey rink.

>Hi Porcheroo

>I am trying to figure out a schedule to get my pucks done. I have the picture glued up. And it just barely makes it. I have a feeling that when all is said and done , it may have to be a tiny bit smaller. It will be close, so getting it just right will make a difference. I am hopin that you could do a couple of things that could save a few hours. (Call me since I can probably answer the phone most of the time.

>I would like you to slice off the ends so we have clear surface for waste blocks on both ends. Using slices from the logs make waste pucks (I think you could actually use the ends that already have the centre holes). Lining up the waste pucks on the picture block should let us see if we need to reduce size. If so, do you think we should turn the logs down to a smaller size?  If the solid puck is bigger than the picture disk, do you think our roller jig would work upside down, with the wheels rolling on the picture part?  Anyway call me. Maybe I will be home by the time you get this.
